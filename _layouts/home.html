<h2>Welcome to the RSE Community in Australia and New Zealand</h2>
<div class="home_header">
	This website is to build awareness of the Research Software Engineer
	(RSE) community and to identify volunteers to help implement the
	practical solutions for the RSE community. If you are an
	academic/researcher who codes but are lacking recognition and metrics
	needed to progress your academic career; a 'generalist' who brings
	communities together and can engage with both researchers and technical
	staff; a professional software engineer working in the research space;
	or a system administrator who maintains research systems, you should
	think about joining. <br /> <br /> <img src="/assets/rse_melbourne.jpg">
