## The RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand

This community aims to build awareness of the diverse Research Software 
Engineer (RSE) roles, to connect volunteers in the RSE domain, and to 
help build practical solutions for the RSE community. 

This community is for:

The term RSE, originally coined by the 
[UK RSE association](http://rse.ac.uk), 
says the following about RSEs: 
> “A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in 
> programming with an intricate understanding of research. 
> Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, 
> these people lack a formal place in the academic system.”

Inspired by the success of the RSE Association in UK, we are seeking to 
establish an Australasian Chapter of the RSE Association. Together with 
international bodies and support from our national organisations such as 
AeRO, NeSI, CAUDIT, the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), and 
research institutions, we aim to campaign for the recognition and 
adoption of the RSE role within the research ecosystem. Alongside this, 
appropriate recognition, reward and career opportunities for RSEs are 
needed. We plan to organise regular events to allow RSEs to meet, 
exchange knowledge and collaborate on methods to create these 
opportunities.

We ran an initial Expression of Interest survey in 2017 among Australian
 and New Zealand researchers and found that majority of the respondents 
 prioritised:
1. Increased recognition of the RSE role, 
1. More appropriate, consistent and representative position descriptions 
and KPIs, and 
1. Community development through regular events and gatherings. 

Please join us to actively work on how we can grow this community and 
advocate for others. Together, we can build a sustainable community that 
benefits research software engineers, and ultimately contributes to more 
efficient and reproducible research.
