We invite you to join us for the first online Research Software Engineer (RSE) Asia Australia Unconference from the *14th to the 16th of September 2022*. This is a joint partnership between the newly formed [RSE Asia Association](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) and the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io/). We would also like to thank our key partners [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/) and [QCIF](https://qcif.edu.au/) for supporting us, as well as our accessibility partner, the [Society for Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/).

### What is a Research Software Engineer? 

Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g researchers and academics who code, generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains, systems administrators who maintain research systems, and software engineers who work in the research domain. 

### Why participate?

This will be run as a participant-first online unconference to ensure you have a say on how we develop the community and to allow you to share your valuable technical and social knowledge of research software with the community. In line with that, the theme for this year's unconference is “Building community”.

Together, we can create a sustainable community that benefits research software engineers by raising recognition and building career paths for RSEs, and ultimately contributes to more efficient and reproducible research.

We also hope that this experience will identify ways to positively engage with senior leaders who are working on policies that directly affect you and the rest of the RSE community. 

### What is an unconference?

The unconference will run online over three half-days. An unconference is where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space [1]. 

For this particular unconference, we will create breakout groups for the top three topics for each session. At the start of each day we will have an introduction session to provide the participants with some ideas on what they might want to discuss during the conference. We aim to summarise topics and make these available publicly after the unconference.

An overview of what the program will look like will be coming soon.

### Accessibility and Inclusivity

We are committed to creating a safe, accessible, and inclusive environment for all participants.

To this end we are offering 50 scholarships for staff or students to participate for free, as well as a $50 AUD accessibility micro-grant to help with internet, headphones, childcare etc.

Eligibility for the scholarships will be based on prioritising and maximising the inclusion and participation of people who have been impacted due to the cumulative effects of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, disability, gender identity, financial status,and the intersectionality of that discrimination as well as others not mentioned here.

Eligibility for the accessibility micro-grants will be based on a similar approach.

### How to apply for the scholarship and accessibility micro-grant

To apply for the scholarship, please email us at rse2022 at rse-aunz.org with the subject [Scholarship] and why you would like to attend for free and how this would benefit you and your organisation (200 words maximum).

To apply for the accessibility micro-grant, please email us at rse2022 at rse-aunz.org with the subject [Accessibility]  and why you would like a micro-grant, how would you use it and how attending would benefit you (200 words maximum).

If you are applying for both, please email us separately.

We encourage participants to apply even if they do not think they are eligible as this will allow us to prioritise and maximise diversity and inclusion. All information will be treated in a confidential manner.

If you feel that the unconference is not matching up to the commitment of these ideals, please let us know by contacting the organising committee at rse2022 at rse-aunz.org.

The Code of Conduct will be announced soon.
