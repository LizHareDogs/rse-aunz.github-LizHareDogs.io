We invite you to join us in the first online Research Software Engineer (RSE) Asia Australia Unconference from the 14th to the 16th of September 2022. This is a joint partnership between the newly formed RSE Asia Association and the RSE Australia New Zealand Association.

This will be run as a participant-first online unconference to ensure you have a say on how we develop the community and to allow you to share your valuable technical and social knowledge of research software with the community. In line with that, the theme for this year's unconference is “Building community”.

### What is a Research Software Engineer? 

Research Software Engineer is a broad term for people in academia who combine expertise in programming with an intricate understanding of research, e.g. researchers and academics who code, generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains, systems administrators who maintain research systems, and software engineers who work in the research domain. 

We hope that this experience will encourage you to engage with senior leaders who are working on policies that directly affect you and the rest of the RSE community. Please join us at this conference to actively work on how we can grow this community and advocate for others. Together, we can build a sustainable community that benefits research software engineers, and ultimately contributes to more efficient and reproducible research.

### What is an unconference?

Optional Hub meet up in person
September 13th evening

The unconference will run online over three half-days. An unconference is where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space [1]. 

For this particular unconference, we will create breakout groups for the top three topics for each session. At the start of each day we will have an introduction session to provide the participants with some ideas on what they might want to discuss during the conference. We aim to summarise topics and make these available publicly after the unconference.

Topics could include things like:
- Reproducible Research
- Career development for RSEs
- Recognition for RSEs
- Improvements in software quality
- Sharing difficulties and failures to help others

Might be fun to also hear about things that failed - "I tried this and found out the hard way that you should not do this!"

An overview of what the program will look like will be coming soon.
