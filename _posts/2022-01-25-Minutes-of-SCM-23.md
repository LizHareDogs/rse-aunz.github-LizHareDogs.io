## Approval of Previous Minutes

Previous minutes unavailable at the time of meeting.

## Planning Activities

-   Confirmation of International RSE council rep

    RM has been approved as our representative to the International RSE council.
    It is recognised that the meetings for that group are scheduled for 1am
    AEDT. We support utilising any opportunity to contribute in a different way
    if timezone makes attendance not workable.

    -   RSE Survey outcome [MS]

        The survey is still open. Response numbers are low. Recommendation to
        advertise to improve numbers.

    -   Direction/Strategy for the new committee

        This item was parked until the next meeting

    -   Social Media guidelines

        Raised that we need some guidelines to direct how messages should be
        sent to the community and a code of conduct on our social media
        accounts. There is nothing written down. Agreement that this would be a
        good idea. This could be added as rules on LinkedIn. All committee
        members are admins on the LinkedIn account.

    -   au-RSE conference ideas

        This item was parked until the next meeting

    -   Domain registration

        This process has been completed (rse-aunz.org). Autoforwarding does not
        appear to work.

    -   Email aliases for domain

        Pending completion of the domain registration. The email aliases will
        not work temporarily.
