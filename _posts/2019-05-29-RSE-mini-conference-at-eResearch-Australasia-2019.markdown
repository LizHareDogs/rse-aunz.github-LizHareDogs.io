At the last interim steering committee meeting on the 28th of May, 
there was agreement to host a *RSE Mini-conference* as an 
*eResearch Australia  2019* pre-conference workshop.

While the idea is to have an unconference type format to make 
organisation easier, we would love for people to volunteer to help.
