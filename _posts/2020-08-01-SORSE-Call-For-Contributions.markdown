A global collaboration has established the [*International Series of Online Research Software Events*](https://sorse.github.io/), aka SORSE (pronounced 'sauce'). The goal is to provide an opportunity for RSEs to develop and grow their skills, build new collaborations and engage with RSEs worldwide.
