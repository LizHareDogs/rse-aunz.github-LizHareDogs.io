## Discussion
For the detailed agenda see: 
[GitHub Issue 84](https://github.com/rse-aunz/rse-au/issues/84)

### 1. Approval of Previous Minutes
See link: [Minutes from Meeting No.1](/2019/10/17/Minutes-of-SCM-01). 
Passed unanimously.
 
### 2. Outcomes of eResAus2019
The RSE Mini-conference was discussed and slides reviewed (agreement 
that it was a very successful event). 

The BoF poll results were discussed: the most popular goal that 
attendees wanted RSE-AUNZ to focus on in 2020 was **Maintain & 
Build Community**. In addition, the sharing of technical knowledge was 
a strong theme that emerged in both sessions.
 
### 3. Goals & Deliverables 2020
See document: [Goals & Deliverables for 2019](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-hhGOw62vy62r-lRT87MXQcfvaFptnqK)

#### D1 (Manifesto or Mission Statement)
It was agreed that the current tagline on the 
[GitHub.io](https://rse-aunz.github.io/) page does not match our target 
community. This needs to be updated before 2020.
It was agreed that we should keep the abbreviation RSE-AUNZ.
It’s a known and understood “brand” and we’d risk losing that if we 
selected something else.

#### D2 (Personas, Profiles, or Personal Stories)
It was suggested that we use the 1-page introductions from the RSE 
Mini-conference as an initial sample of personal stories. However, 
this will require approval by each of the participants for the reuse of 
their slide.
 
#### D3 (Create Impact Stories)
It was noted that the Australasian research context was sufficiently 
different from other regions that we can't just reuse arguments from the
 UK, US and EU to make the case for RSE to local organizations.
A proposal was shared that we should create a white paper to publicise 
the impact of RSE within Australasia and New Zealand.
It was noted that NL-RSE have released a draft white paper (called 
**Raising the profile of Research Software**) and are asking for comment.
 In addition, this effort might benefit from collaboration with the 
 Society of RSE, through the trustees such as Simon Hettrick (Professor 
 of Research Software Engineering).
 
#### D4 (A permanent Web Presence)
Brief discussions about web sites, forums, etc. were had at eResearch 
Australasia 2019 with a potential host for a website. Further 
investigation will be required.

The committee identified several prerequisites to establishing a web 
presence:
- Branding: aligned with the Society of RSE.
- Content: initially from deliverables 1,2, and 3.
- Domain: e.g. rse-aunz.org

Re. Forums. The limitations of Slack.com were discussed, and the 
committee agreed to trial AeRO Chat as an initial option. It was noted 
that further discussion will be required about appropriate options.

Re. Email. Continue with the Google Group for the present.
 
#### D5 (Run Face-to-face Meetings)
It was agreed that face-to-face meetings should be co-located with 
existing events and conferences, as we do not yet have the resources to 
run a program of independent events.
In addition, we should focus on online meetings, advertising and 
communication channels.
 
#### D6 (lnfo pack for Local RSE Groups)
A suggestion was raised that we create stickers and postcards to 
advertise RSE-AUNZ at local meetups/hacky hours and national events. 
It was agreed that this was an excellent idea, but that we would need to
 have a permanent web presence and communications strategy established 
 before advertising to local groups.
 
It was agreed that RSE Champions would be an excellent resource for the 
distribution of info packs.

#### Prioritisation
The relative priority of the deliverables was agreed as falling into 
three levels, with priority 1 being the most urgent and necessary to 
enable the other deliverables.

- Priority 1
	- D4 (Establish a permanent Web Presence)
- Priority 2
	- D1 (Publish a Manifesto or Mission Statement)
	- D2 (Define Personas, Profiles, or Personal Stories)
	- D3 (Create Impact Stories)
- Priority 3
	- D5 (Run Face-to-face Meetings)
	- D6 (Create an Info Pack for Local RSE Groups)

#### Assignment to Committee Members
Tasks associated with deliverables were assigned during the discussion 
on deliverables and their priority. Oversight of each deliverable was 
not assigned to individuals.
The management of tasks was discussed and the option of using GitHub 
Projects feature was raised. This feature of the RSE-AUNZ GitHub account
 should be for the committee and invited members only.
 
### 4. Casual Vacancies
No nominations have yet been received.
Several conversations with potential candidates were reported. 
The reluctance to nominate was driven by ensuring that they could commit
 sufficient time to the RSE-AUNZ and that the committee was sufficiently 
 diverse. 
The committee discussed the option to on-board these candidates as 
**RSE Champions**. This role would require less commitment than as a 
committee member but could serve as a local point of contact in 
areas/organizations without committee representation. It was agreed that
 this role would need to be clarified before appointing candidates to 
 positions.
It was agreed that there was no urgency to fill these vacancies at this 
time, as we can focus available efforts on the high priority deliverables.
It was suggested that we have another round of advertising, but with a 
simpler message. Also, agreed that new members should aim to on-board in
 Jan. 2020.
 
### 5. Any other business
None.
