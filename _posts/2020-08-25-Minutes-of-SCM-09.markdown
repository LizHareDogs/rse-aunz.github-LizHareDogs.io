### 3. Discussion of Online Events for 2020

The committee has decided to submit abstracts for three sessions at eRA2020. These include two Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions and one oral presentation. It was agreed that all committee members should provide input on all abstracts, but the abstract should be assigned to three committee members to manage the submission process. Assignments are listed in the **Actions Carried Forward** section below.

### 4. Election 2020

The committee reviewed the dates and process for the 2020 Election. A proposal was made to increase the period for which committee members are elected and to provide more continuity of operation. The committee agreed to change the period from the current one year to two year. In addition, the committee agreed that only half of the committee (i.e. four positions) will be elected each year.

To manage the transition to these new election arrangements, the committee agreed to extend the servicing period of the existing six members until the 2021 election, and open the 2020 election for four new positions. This will temporarily increase the total number of committee positions available to ten until the 2021 election, after which it will revert to the normal eight positions.

The committee discussed the provisional dates for the election and agreed to move the nomination period, so that it will be open before and after eRA2020. This will provide an opportunity for RSE-AUNZ to advertise to the members before and during events at eRA2020.

The agreed dates for 2020 election are as follows:

| Period           | Start Date     | End Date       |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Nomination       | Mon. 12th Oct. | Sun. 1st Nov.  |
| Confirmation     | Mon. 2nd Nov.  | Sun. 8th Nov.  |
| Voting           | Mon. 9th Nov.  | Sun. 22th Nov. |
| Results Declared | Mon 23rd Nov.  |                |

The committee agreed to invite Matthias Liffers (ARDC) to oversee the 2020 election as returning office; a position he filled for the 2019 election.

### 5. Casual Vacancies

The committee has agreed to defer appointment until after the 2020 election, should there be positions vacant.

### 6. Any other business

Several committee members have been invited to take part in the podcast called [RSE Stories](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/). We aim to publish posts to advertise these sessions when they are available online.
