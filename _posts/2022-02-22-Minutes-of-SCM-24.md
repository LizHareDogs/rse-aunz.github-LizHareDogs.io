## Approval of Previous Minutes

Previous minutes unavailable at the time of meeting.

## Planning Activities

-   Welcome Paula to the committee. Looking forward to working together

    -   Change meeting time to 8am WA time

    -   

    -   Quarterly online event - previously discussed planning of webinar
        series. Never got off the ground with the last committee. Will be
        somewhat superseded by the RSE conference. But a need for smaller, more
        frequent events (webinars or local meetups) to grow engagement outside
        of the annual conference is recognised. ARDC may be able to assist with
        organisation.

    -   RSE Survey - closes end February. An event to present results would need
        to be in late March/early April **ACTION tentative Report on RSE survey
        results in April. investigate live-stream options with anonymous chat
        function**

    -   

    -   Direction/Strategy of committee - We need to think about how we operate.
        Do we want to remain high level contributors with a lot of community
        engagement for direction through the mechanisms of the conference and
        mailing list engagement. Or deal with more minutiae. But maybe we build
        a starting point for the conversation. What does the future look like?

    -   Potential RSE Australia conference/eResearch collab - Not discussed

    -   Outreachy - Not discussed

    -   Metrics for RSE contributions - Not discussed

    -   Impact stories - Not discussed
