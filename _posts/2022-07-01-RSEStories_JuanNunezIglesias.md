<figcaption>The napari viewer displaying several image processing and analysis steps performed on a 3D image of an olfactory projection neuron from the DIADEM challenge (top left). The image was thresholded with scikit-image, cleaned with a morphological closing, labelled, skeletonized, the skeleton was trimmed interactively in napari, then analysed with skan â€” each branch is coloured by its computed length.
