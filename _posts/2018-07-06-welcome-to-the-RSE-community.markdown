Hi there and welcome to the RSE Community in Australia and New Zealand.

This website is to build awareness of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) community and to identify volunteers to help implement the practical solutions for the RSE community. If you are an academic/researcher who codes but are lacking recognition and metrics needed to progress your academic career; a professional software engineer working in the research space; or a system administrator who maintains research systems, you should think about joining. 

You can join by clicking on the "Want to keep up to date? Sign up here" link at the bottom of the page.
