This meeting, on the 14th of August at the Parkville Campus at 
University of Melbourne, is to build awareness of the Research Software 
Engineer (RSE) community and to identify volunteers to help implement 
the practical solutions for the RSE community. If you are an 
academic/researcher who codes but are lacking recognition and metrics 
needed to progress your academic career; a professional software 
engineer working in the research space; or a system administrator who 
maintains research systems, you should think about joining.
