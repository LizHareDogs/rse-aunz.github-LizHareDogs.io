We would like to know which topics you would be interested in learning more about. The link above provides a place for you to add and describe your topic ideas, add feedback on other peoples ideas, and vote for your favourites. No sign-up is required, just follow the link to the Tricider platform and get voting.

At regular intervals, we will select the top voted topic and organise an online event around that subject.

The next deadline is set for 31st August.
