There was plenty of discussion in the RSE pre-conference workshop 
*Recognition and Career Development for Researchers who Code* that was 
held at eResearch Australasia on the 16th of October. 
There was even more at the BoF the next day. These discussions resulted 
in two realisations. The first one was that while our main focus is 
helping researchers who code get recognised, we also need to do the same
for *generalists*, people who bring communities together and can engage 
with both researchers and technical staff. The second realisation was 
that we are still in an embryonic phase and we need to get more people 
involved to get a critical mass.

What was great about both meetings was that we had a range of people 
from all over Australia and New Zealand all willing to help grow the 
community.
